                <p>Money transfer was a big problem to the community.  The only way money was to be sent was through mail and money order. This became tiresome and risky since some can be operating with large sum of money.</p>
                <p>The solution to this was mpesa. This is where money is sent easily through our phones and phone number. This can be done between people who are far apart from each other. This made it easier to do business since transaction is quick and fast.</p>
                <p>Since we are in a world where technology is growing fast, many people embraced this idea leaving behind the old way for it was outdated. This positivity helped mpesa grow so fast and became most common and cheap idea of sending and receiving money in businesses.</p>
                <p>Through this idea alot of innovations followed. For example mshwari was an invention of mpesa where you can open a savings account and save money. Mpesa also invented fuliza where one can also take a loan and repay later with cheap interest.</p>
